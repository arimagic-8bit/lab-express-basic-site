        Jane Austen (/ˈɒstɪn, ˈɔːs-/; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an
        English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which
        interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the
        end of the 18th century. 
      </p>
      <p class="col-sm text-justify">
        Austen's plots often explore the dependence of
        women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and
        economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the
        second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to
        19th-century literary realism.
      </p>
      <p class="col-sm text-justify">
        Her use of biting irony, along with
        her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim
        among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.
